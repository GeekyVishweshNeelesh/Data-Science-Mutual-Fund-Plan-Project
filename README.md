## 📁 Project Structure

- `Mutual_Fund_Plan_Colab.ipynb` – Main notebook for analysis and visualization  
- `Dataset/` – Contains the raw mutual fund data  
- `Images/` – Plots and visualizations exported from the notebook  
- `readme.md` – Project overview and documentation

---

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas` – Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- `numpy` – Numerical operations  
- `plotly` – Interactive data visualizations  

---

## 📊 Objective

- Load and process mutual fund return data
- Visualize performance across different timeframes
- Identify top-performing funds based on historical trends
- Enable informed decision-making for long-term investment
